- 👋 Hi, I’m @FowlBird13
- 👀 I’m interested in life and experimenting with how to get the most out of it with the least effort.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning so much that sometimes it feels like all of the world's voices have free rent in my brain.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the unknown, the improbably, and the extremely satirical.
- 📫 How to reach me reach out your hand and think of your grandmother's favorite color, whisper a secret you've only told your closest friend, then roll your eyes twice. Do all this, and I shall appeare.
